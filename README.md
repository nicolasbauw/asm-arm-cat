# cat command written in ARM assembly (linux)

This is a very basic ```cat``` command written from scratch in 32 bits ARM assembly.  
It just opens a file and displays it (max size 2k).

The source shows how to:
- use command line arguments
- make system calls

Makefile will build with debug symbols, so you can have some fun with gdb :-)
